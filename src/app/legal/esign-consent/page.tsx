        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          This Agreement for Electronic Transactions and Consent to Electronic Records ("E-SIGN Agreement") is entered 
          into between you, the individual user ("You"), and XtraFleet Technologies Inc. ("XtraFleet"), including any 
          of its affiliates.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          This E-SIGN Agreement applies to your use of the services provided by XtraFleet (the "XtraFleet Services"), 
          including, without limitation, your use of XtraFleet's website located at www.xtrafleet.com (the "Site") 
          and the XtraFleet web or mobile application (the "XtraFleet Web App").
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          This E-SIGN Agreement governs any transaction conducted with XtraFleet and the delivery, receipt, retention, 
          or access of any record, document, or communication provided in connection with the XtraFleet Services.

            Under this E-SIGN Agreement, you are asked to consent to two primary matters:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            <li>Conducting transactions with XtraFleet through electronic means; and</li>
            <li>Receiving all agreements, disclosures, notices, communications, and records relating to the XtraFleet Services in electronic form rather than on paper.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            Please read this E-SIGN Agreement carefully and retain a copy for your records.

              IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS ELECTRONICALLY AND TO RECEIVE RECORDS AND COMMUNICATIONS 
              IN ELECTRONIC FORM, YOU MAY NOT OPEN OR MAINTAIN A XTRAFLEET ACCOUNT, AND YOUR ACCESS TO THE XTRAFLEET 
              SERVICES MAY BE TERMINATED.

          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-3">b. Optional Alternative Methods</h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            From time to time, either you or XtraFleet may elect to conduct a transaction using an alternative 
            method (such as orally over the telephone). Any such alternative method does not modify, limit, or 
            revoke this E-SIGN Agreement or your consent to transact electronically.
