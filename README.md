## Enabling Firebase Authentication

This project uses Firebase for user authentication. Before you can create user accounts, you must enable the Email/Password sign-in provider in your Firebase project.

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Select your project.
3.  In the left-hand navigation, go to **Build > Authentication**.
4.  Click the **Sign-in method** tab.
5.  Click on **Email/Password** in the list of providers.
6.  Enable the provider and click **Save**.

After you've done this, you will be able to create new user accounts in the application.
